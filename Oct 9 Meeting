==October 9 Meeting==
Time: 12:00
Participants: Mack, Piyush

==Ideas for Meeting==
The test will be an SQL query.
Piyush has used SQL in general, Postgresql

==Plan for this long weekend==
Piyush will finish the SQL database, and make a test editor. []
Mack will attempt to make a Docker container out of it. I will try to make two separate containers.

===Other notes===
Write documentation for the docker run and docker build.

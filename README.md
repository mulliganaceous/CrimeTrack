This application involves the **Python** language and the **datasette** and **sqlite-utils** packages. 

# Cloning
Run the following command in your terminal to clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/philippejlyu/CSC302.git
```

# Running
Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository locally (folder named `CSC302`) and execute the following command in your terminal to run the application in a browser window:
```
./run.sh
```

Since this is a toy application that can be built and run with just one shell file, we decided to put the Docker containerization on hold until A2.

created github repo
We want to make it public

invited both to github as collaborators

Talk about assignment


2 things to start off

thinkg what we want the tech stack to be


what do we want the data to be


get data, import it into 

datasette, a tool for exploring and publishing data
we lookeda tthe demo



we will use datsette for data presentation

SQLite

We need reasoning for each part of the tool we need 


for the toy application, use datasette to show the data

create a hard-coded example

later on, we want the whole application with mvp, user can look at any piece of data and visualize whatever

do we want to create our own dataset, or use something from kaggle

looking at a few possibilities for data

Crimes in US communities

excellent dataset



why we think this is interesting

Seeing hotspots for crime, even visualizing them is interesting to see, 
look into live data source for crime data, this might just be a few cities


someone confirm with prof to see if this dataset is good


tech stack

lots of the backend stuff is taken care of datasette wise

We need to get the datasource, put it in a database, use datasette to create a visualization

The bulk of the work is creating the surrounding UI for the visualization, UI should have a way to upload the data, 

input into sqlite database, call to the db and send to datasette 

frontend where the user can upload the data, any data they want, also having a selector for what visualizaiton they want

containerization
using docker is fine, just create a dockerfile

prelim project development plan
how we want to split up the work

how that looks like for each milestone




action items
look more into datasette
see what we can do, how easy it is to interface, how to cast the data, what format

think about more features the app should have
	maybe a selector for different visualizations


for UI, we can use react, see what we can do

backend is probably bulk of the work, use python probably
